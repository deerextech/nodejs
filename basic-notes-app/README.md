If for some reason you are a human who is looking to clone and use this...lol..
congrats, i guess? Why it would be helpful to you is beyond me

I just whipped together a tiny NodeJS example for myself
Built Node Version 7...
Clone & npm install.

To run:

$ node app.js [command]

Available commands:
1. add
2. list
3. remove
4. read
5. --help

Example:
node app.js add -t="Example Title" -b="Example body"
node app.js read -t="Example Title"
node app.js remove -t="Example Title"
node app.js list


basic references folder just has some examples of emitters.
Not important to this specific mini project.
